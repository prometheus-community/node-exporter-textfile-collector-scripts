#! /bin/sh -
#
# Expose metrics about the status of FreeBSD rc(8) services.
#
# SYNOPSIS
#	freebsd-rc-service.sh [-i ignored]
#	freebsd-rc-service.sh -h
#
# DESCIPTION
# This script should probably run as UID 0 in order to be able to successfully
# get the status of each service (e.g., as of FreeBSD 14.0-CURRENT, the cron's
# PID file is readable only to UID 0).
#
# A status metric is provided for a service if:
# - The service is enabled.
# - The service provides a status command.
# - The service is not ignored via the -i flag.
#
# This script accepts the following flags:
# -h		Print help and exit.
# -i ignored	Ignore specified services. Services have to be listed
#		by their absolute paths,
#		e.g., "/etc/rc.d/sendmail /etc/rc.d/ip6addrctl".
#
# METRICS
# This script provides the following metrics:
#
# - freebsd_rc_service_status{path="PATH"} STATUS
#   where:
#   - PATH is an absolute path to the service script
#   - STATUS is 1 if the "quietstatus" command was successful, 0 otherwise.
